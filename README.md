The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of arithmetic, relational and logical operators
and if statements.

In this project, there is a function which evaluate an expression that includes
the custom operators "+", "plus", "-" and "minus" which are capable of operating on either "double" or "char array" 
left and right operands. It also contains a separate function to perform the "minus" operator when acting on two char 
array operands.
